I created this Github account for the course CTI-110 at Wake Tech Community College. This is my second experience using Github.
I created this repository for the Lesson 6 Lab. This is my first time creating a repository and I am very new to navigating and using Github.
First I had to create a Github account and download Github Desktop. I then clicked clone repository in Github Desktop and selected the repository I had previously made in the browser.
